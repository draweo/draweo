Hi, this is **draweo** 👋 Welcome to my **GitHub** account.

## Thanks for joining me on my coding and data adventure! 🐍   
### Be gentle, I'm still learning 💩😆 

I'm excited to discover as much of the world of coding as I can...endlessly working to tame a Python! 😅

More **strings** than a puppet show, more **loops** than a rollercoaster, more **floats** than a swimming lesson and, it's **TRUE**...there are a few Booleans in there too.

**While** the world of code challenges me, **if** you can help me along the way I'd appreciate it, **else** constructive criticism would be great. ♥️

I've spent 15 Years (and counting) in the wine industry, utilising the following skills, which I hope will help me navigate the world of tech too:
* **Creating training programmes**
* **Delivering training**, both sales training and product training
* **B2B Sales** (to both hospitality and retail)
* **Sales presentations**
* **Account management**
* **Wine list strategy reviews and sales analysis**

Complementary creative skills and experience include:
* **Graphic design** (Photoshop, Illustrator, In Design)
* **Branding** (Brand design and brand building for my own brands and others)
* **Website Design** (Using Wix)

Cheers 🍻
